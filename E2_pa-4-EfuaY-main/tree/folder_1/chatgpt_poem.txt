The First "Hello"

In a world of silence, void and still,
A whisper forms by human will.
Fingers tap, the keys align,
A spark ignites in lines of rhyme.

"Hello," it says, a simple start,
A greeting born from code and heart.
In timeless space where bits unfurl,
We send our message: "Hello, world!"

A phrase so small, yet vast and wide,
It travels far, no need to hide.
From early days in ancient screens,
To modern realms where AI gleams.

With every "hello," a journey's made,
A bridge to thoughts that won’t soon fade.
The code evolves, as do we all,
Yet still we echo that first call.

From classrooms bright to late-night hacks,
The words return, they lead us back.
Through every loop and nested whirl,
We speak again: "Hello, world!"

The joy of code, the art of play,
Begins with greetings we relay.
For every program, old or new,
It starts with "hello" — a path to view.
